# Anomaly Generation Testing Documentation

## üéØ Overview

This directory contains comprehensive testing and validation for the Enhanced SNN anomaly generation system. The anomaly generation creates synthetic anomalies in neuromorphic event data for supervised anomaly detection training.

## üß™ Test Coverage

### Anomaly Types Tested
1. **Contextual Blackout** - Simulates sensor failure by reducing activity in high-activity regions
2. **Adaptive Vibration** - Simulates camera shake/vibration with motion-based noise patterns
3. **Temporal Polarity Flip** - Simulates hardware errors by swapping positive/negative event polarities

### Test Scenarios
- **Individual Type Testing**: Each anomaly type tested in isolation with multiple parameters
- **Smart Selection Testing**: Intelligent anomaly type selection based on frame characteristics
- **Realistic Frame Testing**: Testing with neuromorphic-like sparse event data
- **Edge Case Testing**: Empty frames, single-polarity regions, high-activity frames

### Frame Types Used
- **High Activity**: Dense random events (triggers blackout anomalies)
- **Sparse Events**: Scattered DVS camera-like events (triggers polarity flips)
- **Edge Activity**: Motion boundary patterns (triggers polarity flips)
- **Clustered Events**: Object motion patterns (triggers polarity flips)
- **Almost Empty**: Minimal activity frames (triggers vibration)
- **Separated Polarities**: Clear pos/neg regions (for polarity flip validation)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Smart Selection Logic
```python
# Neuromorphic-optimized thresholds
if activity_level > 0.05:  # High activity
    return contextual_blackout(severity based on activity)
elif sparsity > 0.005 or total_events > 1.0:  # Moderate sparsity
    return polarity_flip(pattern based on sparsity)
else:  # Very low activity
    return vibration(coherent pattern)
```

### Enhanced Polarity Flip
- **Problem**: Flipping sparse regions with only one polarity resulted in no changes
- **Solution**: Add complementary activity before flipping to ensure visible differences
- **Implementation**: Detects pos-only/neg-only regions and adds minimal opposing activity (0.05 intensity)

### Contextual Blackout
- **Activity-Aware**: Targets high-activity regions using 70th percentile threshold
- **Severity Scaling**: Mild (50%), medium (80%), severe (100%) intensity reduction
- **Adaptive Sizing**: Region size scales with severity and frame dimensions

### Adaptive Vibration
- **Motion Patterns**: Coherent directional vs random noise
- **Regional Application**: Noise applied to specific regions, not entire frame
- **Intensity Control**: Proper scaling and clamping to [0,1] range

## üîß Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Polarity Flip Zero-Difference Bug ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Flipping regions with only positive OR negative events produced no detectable changes
- **Root Cause**: Flipping zeros to zeros, or single-polarity regions
- **Fix**: Enhanced logic to add complementary activity before flipping

### 2. Smart Selection Threshold Issue ‚ùå‚Üí‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Thresholds too high for realistic sparse neuromorphic data
- **Root Cause**: Original thresholds designed for synthetic dense data
- **Fix**: Lowered thresholds for neuromorphic characteristics (0.1‚Üí0.05, 0.1‚Üí0.005)

## üé¨ Visual Verification

The test generates comprehensive before/after visualizations showing:
- **Original Frames**: Neuromorphic event data
- **Anomalous Frames**: Same frames with injected anomalies
- **Difference Maps**: Highlighting changes using hot colormap
- **Mask Overlays**: Red regions showing anomaly locations
